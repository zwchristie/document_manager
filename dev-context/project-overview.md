# Document Management Micro Front-End Application

## Project Purpose

The application serves as a document ingestion pipeline and enrichment layer for a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) knowledge base. Its primary goal is to capture, enrich, and structure technical documentation to make it LLM-optimized and searchable.

### Core Objectives
- Make documentation creation frictionless for developers
- Enrich natural language descriptions into structured, comprehensive documentation
- Prevent duplicate documentation through intelligent drift detection
- Build a connected system mapping dependencies and business logic across enterprise modules

## Key Workflow

1. **Input**: Developers provide natural language descriptions of functionality, architecture, or services
2. **Enrichment**: System constructs engineered prompts and sends to LLM for structured documentation generation
3. **Drift Detection**: Query Q&A endpoint to check for existing related documentation
4. **Resolution**: 
   - If no match found: Store new documentation
   - If match found: Detect content drift and ask user for update decision
5. **Storage**: Approved documentation is saved and pushed to knowledge base

## Architecture Goals

### Micro Front-End Design
- Embeddable into existing UI applications
- Self-contained with minimal external dependencies
- Configurable integration points

### Documentation Structure
Support for various documentation types including:
- **Microservice Documentation**
  - Input/output formats
  - Dependencies
  - Business purpose
  - System/module relationships
- **Enterprise Module Mapping** (20+ interdependent modules)
- **API Documentation**
- **Business Logic Documentation**

### Technical Requirements
- Custom LLM API endpoint integration
- Intelligent duplicate detection
- Automated drift analysis
- Structured data output for RAG ingestion

## Known Complexities

1. **Micro Front-End Integration**: Must work seamlessly within existing applications
2. **Enterprise Scale**: Handle 20+ interdependent modules with complex relationships
3. **Drift Detection**: Sophisticated comparison algorithms for content changes
4. **User Experience**: Automated duplicate handling without overwhelming users
5. **Data Structure**: Flexible schema to support various documentation types

## Technical Stack

**Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript (chosen for micro front-end compatibility)
**Build Tool**: Vite (fast development and micro front-end bundling)
**State Management**: Zustand (lightweight, suitable for micro front-end)
**HTTP Client**: Axios (reliable API integration)
**Styling**: CSS Modules + Tailwind CSS (scoped styles for micro front-end)
**Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library

### Infrastructure & DevOps
**Configuration**: Zod-based config validation with environment support
**Logging**: Pino with structured logging and pretty printing for development
**Metrics**: Custom metrics collection with Prometheus integration
**Health Checks**: Comprehensive health monitoring with configurable checks
**Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds and Docker Compose
**Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana stack with pre-configured dashboards
**Development**: Cross-platform setup scripts (Bash + PowerShell)
**Deployment**: Automated deployment scripts with rollback capabilities

### Codebase Analysis Results
- Fresh project with no existing dependencies
- Clean slate for implementing document management system
- Basic directory structure created: components/, services/, utils/, types/

## Open Questions

1. What is the existing technology stack (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)?
2. What are the LLM API endpoint specifications?
3. What is the Q&A endpoint structure for drift detection?
4. What are the knowledge base storage requirements?
5. What embedding mechanisms are preferred for the micro front-end?

## Current Status

2. **Service Layer**: Full API integration (LLM, Q&A, Document services) with enhanced observability
3. **Business Logic**: Prompt engineering, drift detection, and document processing workflows
4. **State Management**: Zustand store with complete document processing pipeline
5. **Micro Frontend**: Embedding capabilities with event bridge and configuration system
6. **Configuration Management**: Centralized, validated configuration with environment support
7. **Observability Stack**: Structured logging, metrics collection, and health monitoring
8. **Containerization**: Production-ready Docker setup with development and production configurations
9. **Development Tools**: Automated setup, development helper scripts, and deployment automation
10. **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics collection and Grafana dashboards

### Architecture Highlights
